Google Data Analysis
How many times do you search Google?

I listed them all, about 38,000 in five years.

Not only looking at things you have searched years ago is interesting and fun; 

First you have to download your search history from google. the file I downloaded had several files within it.
All you need to do is putting the downloaded json files in a folder and insert the path in the code.
If you wish to browse through the history, you can't un-comment the csv file generator. it converts the json files into
one csv file.
